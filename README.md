## What is Software Engineering?
According to IEEE Standards, 1993: “The application of a systematic, disciplined, and quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software, that is, the application of engineering to software.”

## Soft skills comparision
In Uady´s curriculum soft skills are stated as graduation skills, specifically, in each of the four competency areas there is a section that describes different communication, creative and emotional abilities in an unambiguous and understandable manner. 
the abilities are developed trough each of the classes, with an emphasis on developing soft skills through teamwork and sections where you must communicate your ideas to the class.

UPQROO´s program doesn´t include a clear description of the desired soft skills, but there are many different classes that are dedicated to the developing soft skills like “EXPRESIÓN ORAL Y ESCRITA I”, “DESARROLLO HUMANO Y VALORES”, “INTELIGENCIA EMOCIONAL Y MANEJO DE CONFLICTOS”, “HABILIDADES COGNITIVAS Y CREATIVIDAD” etc. 

We personally think that Uady´s focus is more adequate since it resembles the real-world use of soft skills more where you have to apply them In different scenarios and projects, as well as being more manageable and constant trough the duration of the program
